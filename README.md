## Problem Statement

Namma Yatri, a leading transportation service, is struggling with the effective management and analysis of trip-related data. The lack of a robust platform to visualize and derive insights from trip information has resulted in operational inefficiencies, increased costs, and diminished customer satisfaction.

This dashboard provides a comprehensive solution for transportation services to streamline operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and facilitate data-driven decision-making. By consolidating trip-related data into a single, easily navigable interface, it offers a holistic view of operational dynamics. This leads to improved efficiency through optimized routes, reduced idle times, and better resource allocation, ultimately lowering operational costs such as fuel consumption and vehicle maintenance.

Since, number of incompleted trips (1178) are more than completed trips (983), thus in all they must work on improving their services. 


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected.
- Step 5 : In the Visualizations section, under "Format your report page", Canvas background was selected to select the background color of the dashboard.
- Step 6 : Visual filter (Slicer) was added for selecting "Assembly".
- Step 7 : Five card visuals were added to the canvas, representing total number of completed trips, total searches, total estimates, total quotes & total driver earnings.
    #### i) Total Number of Completed Trips: 
    Displays the total count of trips successfully completed. A high number indicates efficient operations and strong demand.

    A card visual was used to represent total count of completed trips.

    #### ii) Total Searches:
    Represents the total number of user searches, reflecting customer interest and potential demand.

    A card visual was used to represent total number of searches.

    ![Tot Searches](https://github.com/painsangeeta/Namma_Yatri_Dashboard/assets/89079621/a31216f8-7b46-4b91-b960-b1d96012d0fa)



    #### iii) Total Estimates:
    Shows how many searches lead to estimates, indicating customer interest and the potential for bookings.

    A card visual was used to represent total number of estimates.

    ![Tot Estimate](https://github.com/painsangeeta/Namma_Yatri_Dashboard/assets/89079621/7884d0d6-6ba0-4d1d-b3f1-0efa9010e99b)



    #### iv) Total Quotes:
    Captures the total number of quotes provided to users, suggesting deeper engagement and interest in services.

    A card visual was used to represent total quotes.

    ![Tot Quote](https://github.com/painsangeeta/Namma_Yatri_Dashboard/assets/89079621/58f53acc-f292-4ba7-ae11-187d27b99155)
    
    
    
    #### v) Total Driver Earnings:
    Reveals the total earnings generated by drivers, serving as a measure of overall revenue and business health.

    A card visual was used to represent total amount of earnings by drivers.

    ![Tot Earn](https://github.com/painsangeeta/Namma_Yatri_Dashboard/assets/89079621/b06abdaa-a410-4aeb-90a5-b59480919179)






- Step 8 : A gauge was also added to the report to design the conversion rate which defines the percentage of completing the whole ride.

    Gauge visual to represent conversion rate.

- Step 9 : Three line charts were added to the canvas:
    
    #### i) Trips vs. Duration:
    This chart represents the number of trips for various durations, helping identify peak activity times and understand trip patterns. This aids in optimizing driver schedules and resource allocation.

    A line chart was used to represent trips vs. duration.

    ![Trips vs  Duration](https://github.com/painsangeeta/Namma_Yatri_Dashboard/assets/89079621/de0f2ded-753e-4b9e-adb1-edd1c05f8cb9)
        
    #### ii) Fare vs. Duration:
    This one correlates trip duration with total fare collected. This   relationship indicates whether longer trips yield higher revenue and helps assess pricing strategies. Analyzing this data guides revenue optimization and fare adjustments.

    A line chart was used to represent fare vs. duration.

    ![Fare vs  Duration](https://github.com/painsangeeta/Namma_Yatri_Dashboard/assets/89079621/46d3291a-dde7-4597-bf4d-c268b8a83f91)

    #### iii) Distance vs. Duration:
    This chart illustrates the correlation between distance travelled and trip duration. It is useful for evaluating trip efficiency, identifying outliers, and uncovering potential bottlenecks or operational issues.

    A line chart was used to represent distance vs. duration.

    ![Dist  vs  Duration](https://github.com/painsangeeta/Namma_Yatri_Dashboard/assets/89079621/9b47e8f9-4615-49f4-b728-d87a8809925b)






- Step 10 : In the 'Home' tab, under 'Transform data' section, select  transform data for joining purpose. In the 'Merge Queries' section, select 'Merge Queries as New'. Select 'trip_details' & 'assembly' table, then slelect the matching column to perform left outer join. We have got a new table named 'Merge1'. Following the same process, we have got another table named 'Merge2' by joining 'Merge1' & 'trips' table. Then click on 'Close & Apply' button.
- Step 11 : In the report view, a table visual was added to the canvus to understand the relationship among the data points including total searches, estimates, quotes, distance, total fare, conversion rate.

- Step 12 : A map visual was added to the canvas to count the number of trips by assembly. This is an effective way to visualize the geographical trends of data. By displaying the number of trips by assembly on a map, patterns and trends of trips can be identified based on location.



A map visual was used to represent the count of trips by assembly.

 - Step 18 : The report was then saved as Power BI Template & Export it in PDF format.

# Insights

A single page report was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then exported in PDF format and was saved as Power BI Template.

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

### [1] Total Number of Uncompleted Trips are higher than Total Completed Trips

   Number of total Searches(Total Trips) = 2161

   Number of Completed Trips = 983

   Number of Uncompleted Trips = (2161 - 983) = 1178

    thus, higher number of customers are neutral/unsatisfied.
           
### [2] Fare Doesn't Depend On The Distance travelled & Duration

   From 'Fare Vs. Duration' chart we have got: 
   when Duration = 1, then sum of fare = 45019 which is the highest.

   From 'Distance Vs. Duration' chart we have got:
   when Duration = 14, then total distance = 810 which is highest.

    hence, we see total fare does neither depend on distance nor duration.
